## Installation

To install the `httpclient` package, use Go's package manager:

## Usage
This package simplifies working with HTTP requests and responses. Below are examples of how to use the package.

## Basic Example
Hereâ€™s how to use the httpclient package with a simple GET request:
 
```go

    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
      )

    func main() {
    // Create a new HTTP client
    client := httpclient.New()

    // Make a GET request
    response, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error making GET request: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Print the response
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
    }
```

## Custom Configuration
You can customize the HTTP client with options like custom headers, timeouts, or proxies.
```go
    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
    )

    func main() {
    // Create a new HTTP client with custom settings
    client := httpclient.New(
        httpclient.WithTimeout(10),                // Set timeout to 10 seconds
        httpclient.WithCustomHeader("User-Agent", "MyCustomClient/1.0"),
    )

    // Make a GET request
    response, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error making GET request: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Print the response
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
    }
```
## Handling Timeouts
To handle timeouts, you can configure the timeout value when initializing the client. The client will automatically cancel the request if it exceeds the specified timeout.
```go
    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
    )

    func main() {
    // Create a new client with a 5-second timeout
    client := httpclient.New(httpclient.WithTimeout(5))

    // Make a GET request
    response, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Request timed out or error occurred: %v", err)
    }

    // Print the response
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
    }

```
## Handling Timeouts
To handle timeouts, you can configure the timeout value when initializing the client. The client will automatically cancel the request if it exceeds the specified timeout.
```go

    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
    )

    func main() {
    // Create a new client with a 5-second timeout
    client := httpclient.New(httpclient.WithTimeout(5))

    // Make a GET request
    response, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Request timed out or error occurred: %v", err)
    }

    // Print the response
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
    }
```
## Retries
The httpclient package supports automatic retries for failed requests. You can configure the number of retries and the delay between retries.
```go
    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
    )

    func main() {
    // Create a new client with retry configuration
    client := httpclient.New(
        httpclient.WithRetries(3),                // Retry up to 3 times
        httpclient.WithRetryDelay(2),             // 2-second delay between retries
    )

    // Make a GET request
    response, err := client.Get("https://api.example.com/data")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error making GET request: %v", err)
    }

    // Print the response
    fmt.Println("Response:", response)
    }
```

## Handling JSON Responses
This package also simplifies working with JSON responses. You can decode JSON directly into your structs:
```go
    package main

    import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/srahkmli/httpclient"
    )

    type ApiResponse struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Value string `json:"value"`
    }

    func main() {
    // Create a new HTTP client
    client := httpclient.New()

    // Make a GET request
    var data ApiResponse
    err := client.GetJSON("https://api.example.com/data", &data)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error making GET request: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Print the decoded JSON response
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Value: %s\n", data.Name, data.Value)
    }
```
## Features ðŸ’¡ ðŸ§ 
Customizable timeouts for requests.
Automatic retries on failed requests with configurable retry count and delay.
Custom headers to send with each request.
Flexible HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Supports JSON encoding/decoding for APIs.
Error handling with structured responses.
Request/response logging (optional).


## Configuration Options
 * The package allows you to configure the HTTP client in several ways:

 * Timeout: Set a custom timeout (in seconds).

 * Example: httpclient.WithTimeout(10)

 * Custom Headers: Add custom headers to requests.

 * Example: httpclient.WithCustomHeader("User-Agent", "MyCustomClient/1.0")

 * Retries: Enable automatic retries and configure retry count and delay.

 * Example: httpclient.WithRetries(3), httpclient.WithRetryDelay(2)

 * Logging: Enable or disable request/response logging for debugging.

 * Example: httpclient.WithLogging(true)
